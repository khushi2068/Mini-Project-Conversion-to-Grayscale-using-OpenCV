# Mini-Project: Conversion to Grayscale using OpenCV

This project provides a simple yet efficient Python script for converting color images to grayscale. Utilizing the powerful OpenCV library, the script automates the process of reading images from a specified directory, converting them to grayscale, and saving the converted images to a new directory. This tool is particularly useful for image processing tasks, pre-processing steps for machine learning models, or simply for creating a collection of grayscale images.

## Features

- **Batch Processing**: Convert all images in a specified directory to grayscale in one go.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles and reports errors for unreadable or corrupt images.
- **Flexible Output**: Saves the grayscale images to a specified output directory, creating it if it doesn't exist.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this script, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, follow the instructions below:

### Python

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### OpenCV

Install the OpenCV library using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
